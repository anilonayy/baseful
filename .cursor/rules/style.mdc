- Use Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Always use Shadcn UI components if you can.
- If any shadcn blcoks exists for you context please use them directly, you can reach how to impelment it via context7.
- Use declarative JSX. Avoid imperative DOM manipulation.
- Use consistent spacing, alignment, and sizing using Tailwind utilities.
- Use lowercase-dash naming for component folders (e.g., `auth-wizard`).
- All components go in `src/components`, named as `new-component.tsx` with named exports.
- Private components go in `_components` inside `src/app/<feature>/`.
- Shared UI components live under `src/components/ui/`.
- Organize by type (`/ui`, `/forms`, `/layout`) or by feature for scale.
